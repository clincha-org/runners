Runners for the organisation

Following along
with [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/quickstart-for-actions-runner-controller)

There are two components

- Actions runner controller
- Runner scale sets

I need to set up an organisation runner scale
set. [Documentation](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/choosing-runner-destination.md)
for that is kept separate.
